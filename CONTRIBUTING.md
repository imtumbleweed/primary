## Ground rules & expectations
Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives in writing good quality code or working on a project together. Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* Primary are released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests (No tests are currently set up. Follow this rule when tests are available). If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.

## How to contribute
If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/javascriptteacher/primary/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/javascriptteacher/primary/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first and add a card in Trello. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

## Community
Discussions about the Open Source Guides take place on our Slack and Trello channels. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
